## ACT I

### PROLOGUE

> Two households, both alike in dignity,  
> In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,  
> From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,  
> Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.  
> From forth the fatal loins of these two foes  
> A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;  
> Whose misadventured piteous overthrows  
> Do with their death bury their parents' strife.  
> The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,  
> And the continuance of their parents' rage,  
> Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,  
> Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;  
> The which if you with patient ears attend,  
> What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
