# BOOK I
1. FROM MY GRANDFATHER VERUS, a kindly disposition and sweetness of temper.
2. FROM WHAT I HEARD OF MY FATHER AND MY MEMORY OF HIM, modesty and manliness.
3. FROM MY MOTHER, the fear of God, and generosity; and abstention not only from doing ill but even from the very thought of doing it; and furthermore to live the simple life, far removed from the habits of the rich.
4. FROM MY GRANDFATHER's FATHER, to dispense with attendance at public schools, and to enjoy good teachers at home, and to recognize that on such things money should be eagerly spent.
5. FROM MY TUTOR, not to side with the Green Jacket or the Blue at the races, or to back the Light-Shield Champion or the Heavy-Shield in the lists; not to shirk toil, and to have few wants, and to do my own work, and mind my own concerns; and to turn a deaf ear to slander.
